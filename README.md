### A web application for easily finding national parks, monuments, and lands to do the activities you love most 

## Project Summary
The goal of this project was to create an application using an external api in order to solve a problem for a niche group of users. I love being in the outdoors, and some of my favorites trips have been those to National Parks and Museums. I created this application to allow users to easily sort parks by the activities they love while providing basic park information to kick start their trip planning. The UI is intentionally minimalistic and included limited details to encourage users to peruse their adventures without getting overwhelmed. There is a link to each parks home page available to the user if they want easy access to more information.

This project was also a way for me to develop my skills in React, React Router and Cypress.

## Viewing or Installing the Application

Setup instructions for any and all repos are thorough and verbose enough that even non-technical people (like recruiters) could follow them
